# 3D-scanner
An eye made by python 


A self-designed autonomous 3D scanner using  Sharp IR Sensor, which Creates a
perfect STL( stereolithography, which is the format used in the 3D printer) image by scanning the
entire object placed in the rotating disk of that. It converts the point cloud data from the scanner
to the STL file using  Triangulation techniques . After that rendering was done by blender to
make the surface smooth
